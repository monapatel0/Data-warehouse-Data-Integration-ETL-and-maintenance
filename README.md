# Data-warehouse-Data-Integration-ETL-and-maintenance


Project description. This report is based on conducting a Data mart implementation method on students’ overall criteria of progression. The capacity to assess data, plan crucial facts, and take action in response to changes in the business environment is essential for a firm to advance.
The ETL (EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, AND LOAD) process is done in this report and also shows OLAP (ONLINE ANALYTICS PROCESSING). This report also conducted social ethics. I’m going to discuss how schools, colleges, and universities analyse student academic performance based on modules, years, and marks
